# hiveminding
2D game of evolving distributed intelligence in simulated colonies. Built in GameMaker Studio 2 with GML.

## Description
Using a novel neural network framework enabling direct (neural) communication between agents, intelligence evolves under shared pressures that strongly promote cooperation within a colony and organized competition against other colonies.  

The player adopts a specific colony and exerts influences on it.
